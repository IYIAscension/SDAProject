# SDAProject

In this project we wish to answer the research question:
``Does the degree of authoritarianism (significantly) influence the rollout of vaccinations against COVID-19?''

We have the following hypotheses:
H0: A higher degree of authoritarianism in a country doesnâ€™t lead to a higher rate of vaccination per capita.
H1: A higher degree of authoritarianism in a country leads to a higher rate of vaccination per capita.

The data map has the csv files which we used for our analysis.
