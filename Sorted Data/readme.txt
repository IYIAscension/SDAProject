### Python source files
Command line execution is directly supported for each file. The only file
that requires explicit CLI input is helper.py, which has the syntax:
- python3 helper.py [name_of_dataset]
On Linux or
- py -3.8 helper.py [name_of_dataset]
On Windows.

### C-Sharp source files (See Data Processor / CSV_Data_Processor)
Open the file 'CSV_Data_Processor.sln' with Visual Studio.
Recommended is to use Visual Studio 2019, which is the program that was used to
create said .sln file.

For those unfamiliar with C#:
- A .sln file denotes a Visual Studio project.
- A .csproj file (see subfolders of CSV_Data_Processor) is a file generated by
  Visual Studio which describes a C# project of some sorts. It references the
  files incorporated in the final code assembly, it keeps track of APIs that
  are being referenced by the project, as well as the build configuration.

Opening the .sln file should automatically load up all four projects.
A project, then, is some separate code assembly but is meant as part of the
same overarching project. In the context of this project, one .csproj focuses
on working with CSV files, and one focuses on working with .data files. Both
are .DLL projects, meaning that they emit a code library on compilation.

The remaining two projects (DataMerger and DataReader) are configured as
Console programs, meaning that they emit an executable that generates a console
window when opened.

Finally, Visual Studio (which is different from VSCode) is the recommended C#
code editor, and as such, it has rich support for the C# language, and should
make it most simple to inspect the C# code.

Finally, each of the four .csproj files target .NET Core 3.1 LTS, which is
required to be installed for compilation.
